This project implemented and tested a control method for the e-puck2 robot to explore an obstacle-filled area and pursue an object in an open space. Using IR proximity and ToF distance sensors, the robot successfully navigated both tasks, with only minor performance issues due to real-world uncertainties. Previous assignments provided valuable experience in applying logic to physical robots.
