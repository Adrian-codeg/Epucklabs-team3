This project involved implementing, experiencing, and testing a control method for the e-puck2 robot to achieve two tasks: exploring an enclosed area with obstacles and pursuing an object in an open environment. To complete these two jobs, built-in IR proximity sensors and ToF (time of flight) distance sensors were employed to make logical conclusions. Both tasks were completed satisfactorily, with only minor problems in robot performance due to the inherent uncertainties connected with actual robots. The completion of the previous assignments helped in comprehending the issues related with the application of logic on real robots.
